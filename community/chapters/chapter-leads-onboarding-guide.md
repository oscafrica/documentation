# Chapter Leads OnBoarding Guide

Open Source Community Africa \(OSCA\) is an inclusive community for open-source lovers, enthusiasts, advocates, and experts within Africa.

Our goal is to increase the rate of credible contributions by African software developers, designers, writers, and everyone involved in the sphere of technology to open source projects both locally and globally, changing Africans' perception from just the billion users to the **NEXT BILLION CREATORS**.

### Recommended Practices

Successful leads ensure that the local community they lead embodies OSCA’s core mission and goals. We strongly recommend the following:

#### Promote Open Source Community Africa in your City.

* Evangelize the OSCA program within your local tech community.
* Share updates about your chapter through your different social media channels \(LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp, etc.\)
* Act as a mentor to the community; connecting people, and identifying partnerships.

#### Lead an engaged Discord communication Channel for your chapter.

* Promote ongoing discussion and knowledge sharing.
* Post content and resources about open-source frequently.
* Understand your community members’ interests.

#### Host events.

* Plan a physical meet up at least once in three months to avoid being blacklisted. 
* Invite local or global technical/non-technical speakers with experience in the covered topics.
* Communicate and partner with local communities, tech hubs, and influencers.

#### Coordinate with OSCA’s community managers.

* Participate in the monthly review meeting with your community manager.
* Coordinate with the Open Source Community Africa for support in planning your event \(swag, promotion, etc.\). 
* Submit event reports after every meetup/event you organize for your local community.

### Social Media

As an OSCA lead, you represent us and our value and we implore you to use any hate speech on social media. Find below guides to follow via interacting with members of your community:

1. Create a Twitter account for your chapter and customize the account.
2. Ensure that the account name always starts with OSCA followed by the chapter name \(e.g OSCA Lagos\), and the handle should be OSCA \(in lowercase\) followed by the chapter name \(e.g @oscalagos or @osca-lagos\).
3. Upon creating a social account for your chapter, kindly copy, edit and use this for your chapter’s bio: "_Open Source Community Africa \[insert chapter name\] is a chapter of_[ __](https://twitter.com/SheCodeAfrica)\_\_[_@oscafrica_](https://twitter.com/oscafrica) _focused on increasing the rate of credible contributions by Africans to open source projects both locally and globally in \[Chapter’s city, Country\]_."
4. Always tag @oscafrica when creating awareness about your events or initiatives.
5. Use the hashtags like **\#OSCAUyo**. That is, \#OSCA{City of your chapter}
6. When giving out information, ensure that it is from a reliable source.
7. Do not post negative information about OSCA or its affiliates or partners.

# OSCA Events Code of Conduct

All organizers, attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at OSCA community events are required to agree to uphold the following code of conduct. Open Source Community Africa community event organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment.

The Quick Version Open Source Community Africa is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion \(or lack thereof\), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers.

The Less Quick Version Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsors or vendors booths or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Sponsor staff \(including volunteers\) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organizing team immediately. If you have concerns about a member of the organizing team, please email events@oscafrica.org.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at all Open Source Community Africa related event venues.
